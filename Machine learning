Abstract
Machine learning models are being used more and more frequently across a range of sectors, including banking and healthcare. These models are not, however, impervious to fairness and explicability problems. In this essay, we explore the research on how these two crucial machine learning fields connect. In particular, we investigate the ideas of explainability and fairness, as well as failure situations for machine learning models and approaches for handling explainability and fairness in these models. Our analysis reveals that even while these problems have been addressed, there is still much to be done to increase the accountability and openness of machine learning models.


Introduction:
To create predictions and streamline decision-making processes, machine learning models are trained on big datasets. To increase efficiency and accuracy, these models are employed in a variety of sectors, including healthcare and banking. Nonetheless, there are questions concerning fairness and explainability as a result of the rising use of machine learning algorithms. The ethical treatment of people, regardless of their color, gender, or other protected qualities, is referred to as fairness. Contrarily, explainability refers to the capacity to comprehend how a machine learning model came to a specific conclusion. In this essay, we examine the research on how explainability and fairness interact in machine learning models.

Case Scenarios:
The difficulties of fairness and explainability in machine learning models are illustrated by a number of case studies. For instance, in 2018 Amazon discontinued a machine learning technique that was used to discriminate against female candidates while screening employment applicants. Over a ten-year period, the tool was trained using resumes given to the organization; as a result of the workforce's predominance of men, the model came to favor male candidates. Another case study uses a machine learning algorithm to identify individuals who would benefit from further medical attention. White patients received more care than black patients, even when their health status was identical, as a result of the model's bias towards black patients.

The handling of fairness and explainability in machine learning models has been addressed in a number of different ways. Developing interpretable models, such decision trees, that can clearly explain how the model came to a certain choice, is one approach. Another approach is to use model-independent techniques to explain the choices made by complex models, such as LIME and SHAP. A number of methods, including equalized odds and demographic parity, have been suggested to ensure that machine learning models treat people fairly. To find and correct bias in machine learning models, it has also been advised to employ a variety of datasets and auditing techniques.

Future Works:
Fairness and explainability in machine learning models are difficult and ongoing problems. The development of more reliable techniques for guaranteeing that machine learning models are fair and explicable should be the main emphasis of future research. This could entail researching novel approaches for model fairness and interpretability as well as creating tools for auditing and maintaining machine learning models. Furthermore, increasing accountability and transparency will depend on stakeholders being made aware of the significance of fairness and explainability in machine learning models.

Conclusion:
The literature review concludes by emphasizing the significance of resolving the fairness and explainability issues in machine learning models. If these problems are not addressed, biased and unfair decision-making processes may result, which could have serious repercussions on both people and society as a whole. The solutions suggested to address these problems, such as interpretable models and fairness methodologies, offer an excellent place to start when enhancing the accountability and transparency of machine learning algorithms. Since there is still much to be done in this field, future research should concentrate on creating more reliable techniques for guaranteeing that machine learning models are fair and explicable.
